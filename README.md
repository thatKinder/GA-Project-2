# GA-Project-2
2nd assignment for General Assembly

Several options seem doable for my project, but I’m unsure how complicated some aspects would be. One of the perks of my last project was that I’d ended up looking some for a suitable API for it to do in the event I had extra time to work on it (so much for that lol)

This is the GitHub I found that holds that data in place. I could use it to create a ‘character previewer’ with images, statistics, 'element' and rarity in the game its from. I'm happy to try using a different API instead, but this one came to mind
